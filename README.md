## IIT Bombay - DEEP LEARNING BOOTCAMP

I took part in a four week long deep learning bootcamp which was organized by the IIT Bombay in association with Dphi.

### WEEK 1
It was completely focused on introduction to basic neural networks. Neural networks are very powerful and effective in learning complex functions between input features and output. Finally after learning the theoretical aspect we learnt how to use basic neural networks for regression and the classification task. This was a very effective part of the learning material which helps bridging the gap between the theoretical knowledge of the neural networks and using them in the real life.

### WEEK 2
This week was very intense as this week covered advanced topics like hyperparameter tuning, computer vision and convolutional neural netwroks. With the same model and the data hyperparameters becomes one of the important factor becaause by tweaking them we can achieve higher accuracy with rest same. Then we learn how to use OpenCV which is a open source library used for image data processing very easily. Then we learnt about CNN which are the basis of many state of the art computer vision models today. Convolutions present in a CNN helps to extract important features which helps us to learn a better function to perform some classification task then with a netwrok which does not contain convolutional layers.

### WEEK 3
This week was devoted for revision and clearing backlog if any. This helped us a lot to revise and soak in all the advanced concepts which has been taught in this short span of two weeks.

### WEEK 4
This week's learning material includes a gentle introduction to LSTMs and GANs. This followed by a graded challenge for the evaluation purpose and an opportunity to work with a real world data set.

In this challenge we were supposed to develop a claassifier which takes input an image and tell the weather represented in that image. Refer to my <a href='https://www.kaggle.com/code/abhishek123maurya/iitb-deep-learning-gc/notebook' target='_blank'>notebook</a> on kaggle to see how I have performed visualization of the data given and convolutions which helped me to achieve 3rd place in this hackathon with a 94% accuracy on the test data.
